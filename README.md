Mender Python Client: A Python implementation of the Mender client
==============================================

![Mender logo](mender_logo.png)

## Overview

The _Mender Python Client_ is an API client, which is responsible for
interacting with the Mender server, and downloading the Artifact for a
deployment to a specified location on the device, and then exit until a local
sub-updater on the device has handled the update, reported the update status
(failed, or success), and re-started the _Mender Python Client_ thereafter.

## Workings

The _client_ in daemon mode does periodic checks for updates at a configureable
interval, and downloads the Artifact for the deployment to a given location on
the device. Then control is passed over to the _sub-updater_ through calling the
script `/usr/share/mender/install <path-to-downloaded-artifact>`.

It is then the responsibility of the _sub-updater_ to unpack the Artifact, and
install it to the passive partition, reboot the device, commit the update (or
roll back in case of errors, if so is required). Then report the update status
through calling `mender-python-client report <--success|--failure>`, and then
remove the lock-file, to have the _Mender Python Client_ start looking for
updates again.

After a succesful update, the _sub-updater_ is responsible for updating the
_artifact_info_ file located in `/etc/mender/artifact_info`, to reflect the name
of the Artifact just installed on the device. This is important, as this is the
version reported to the _Mender Server_ when polling the server for further
updates. The `artifact_info` file has to have the structure:

```
artifact_name=<name-of-current-installed-artifact>
```

The `device_type` is taken from `<datadir>/device_type` file, and has to have the structure:

```
device_type=<some-device-type>
```

## Configuration

The _Mender Python Client_ has the same configuration setup as the original
client, with a global and a local [configuration
file](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file). However,
with fewer configuration options, due to the minimal nature of the
implementation.

The _Mender Python Client_ respects this subset of configuration variables
supported by the original _Mender Client_:

* [RootfsPartA](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file/configuration-options#rootfsparta)
* [RootfsPartB](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file/configuration-options#rootfspartb)
* [ServerURL](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file/configuration-options#serverurl)
* [ServerCertificate](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file/configuration-options#servercertificate)
* [TenantToken](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file/configuration-options#tenanttoken)
* [InventoryPollIntervalSeconds](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file/configuration-options#inventorypollintervalseconds)
* [UpdatePollIntervalSeconds](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file/configuration-options#updatepollintervalseconds)
* [RetryPollIntervalSeconds](https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/configuration-file/configuration-options#retrypollintervalseconds)
